    <h1>How to Get to Daegu</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Daegu is located in southeastern Korea, ideally positioned at the heart of Northeast Asia. This strategic location allows for excellent transportation connections both within Korea and internationally.
Most international participants of IEEE VR 2026 are expected to arrive via Incheon International Airport, one of the world’s largest and busiest airports. Incheon Airport offers regular service to 188 cities across 58 countries through 87 major international airlines. From Incheon, Korea’s high-speed KTX (Korea Train Express) provides a convenient connection to Daegu, with a travel time of approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes.
Daegu International Airport offers direct flights to 25 cities in 8 countries, including Beijing, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Taipei, Tokyo, and Osaka. Most importantly, it is located just 3 km from EXCO, the proposed venue for IEEE VR 2026.<br/>
Another nearby option is Gimhae International Airport, located about 50 minutes from Daegu by airport limousine bus. Gimhae Airport serves 40 cities in 12 countries, including destinations in China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.

<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>
The Doctoral Consortium at IEEE VR 2026 is a concentrated event where students present their research interests, plans, and results to a panel of researchers in related fields and receive specific and constructive feedback, including opportunities to meet with mentors one-on-one. Accepted students will be expected to give in-depth presentations of their research and will receive valuable comments from mentors and peers. Additionally, accepted students will create a poster about their work to interact with IEEE VR 2026 attendees during DC and a regular conference poster session. Accepted students will have the option to publish their two-page extended abstract in the conference proceedings and to be included in the IEEE VR 2026 online program. Abstracts will be archived in the IEEExplore digital library, in the 2026 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops proceedings.</p>

<h1>ELIGIBILITY AND TOPICS</h1>
<p>Ideal candidates will be in the early or mid-stage of their PhD and should have a solid idea of their research direction as well as dissertation topic, which may still have room for improvement. The consortium welcomes applicants from a broad range of disciplines conducting research related to Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces including VR, MR, AR, 3D user interfaces, human-computer interaction, wearable computing, social informatics, information technology, cognitive science, and related fields.</p>


<h1>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h1>
<p>To apply to the Doctoral Consortium, please submit the following two documents in PDF format via the Precision Conference Doctoral Consortium track at <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/vr26" target="_blank">https://new.precisionconference.com/vr26.</a></p>
<ol>
<li>A Position paper: Submissions should be two pages in length (including references) prepared in IEEE Computer Society VGTC format (see <a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/" target="_blank">https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/</a>). This position paper must clearly motivate, discuss, and summarize the proposed PhD research, describe how the research fits into and advances research in the field, and report on your progress. You may additionally focus on a more specific area of the research if desired. In the concluding section, you should identify two to three questions or areas for improvement that you would like to discuss during the doctoral consortium.</li>
<li>A two-page <strong>Curriculum Vitae.</strong></li>
</ol>

	<h1 id="resources">Paper Video Presentation Guidelines</h1>
	<p>
		While the presentations at IEEE VR 2025 will take place in person, we are committed to ensuring the conference's accessibility offering an online experience for attendees. To this end, plenary sessions will be streamed live, and paper presentations videos will be made available on the conference's on-line channels. Providing your video and closed-caption file is mandatory. To ensure a smooth process, please upload them to PCS by <strong>February 21, 2025, AoE</strong>.
	</p>
	<h2>Guidelines for creating the videos</h2>
	<ul>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The videos should have a duration of 10 minutes, corresponding to the regular presentation time.</li>
        <li><strong>Template:</strong> Use the IEEE VR 2025 template for your video, especially for the title page. The template can be found here: <a href="https://forms.gle/69cqSoWzhBCMSuHp6" target="_blank">IEEE VR 2025 Slide Templates</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution and Format:</strong> The video must be 1080p (HD - 1920x1080 progressive - Aspect ratio: 16:9) and in MP4 format (H.264 compression).</li>
        <li><strong>File Size:</strong> The video file size must not exceed 250MB.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Content:</strong> You may include photos or videos of the authors, though this is not mandatory.</li>
        <li><strong>Copyright Compliance:</strong> Since videos will be posted and accessible on-line later, ensure that all content used is royalty-free.</li>
    </ul>
	<h2>Closed-Caption VTT file and Accessibility</h2>
	<p>
		Together with your video, please prepare a timestamped closed-caption file using the VTT format. For reasons of accessibility, a caption file with an informative description should be included, even if you present audio descriptions. Captions should not be burnt into the video (i.e. no open-captions). Automated captions can be created, for example, via YouTube or otter.ai. Alternatively you can create a transcript and convert it to a caption file, for example via a YouTube video.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tools that could be considered creating closed captions: Youtube, otter.ai.; you can also create/edit closed-captions using the vtt text file, for more information, consider searching for “create vtt file” in your search engine of preference.

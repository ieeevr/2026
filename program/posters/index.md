<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The 33rd IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2026 seeks poster submissions that describe recently completed work, highly relevant results of work in progress, or successful systems and applications in all areas related to virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and 3D user interfaces. Presenting a poster is a great way to get feedback on work that has not yet been published.</p>
<p>Initial submissions should be in the form of a two-page extended abstract, which will undergo a review process. The poster design does not need to be submitted on the initial submission deadline. Authors whose extended abstracts are accepted will be able to submit their poster design as a PDF at the camera-ready deadline so that it will appear together with the extended abstract on IEEE eXplore. In addition, <strong class="red">authors of accepted posters will be required to provide a teaser video and a teaser image</strong>. More information can be found in the Poster Presentation section of this call.</p>
<p>Poster presentations will be at the physical conference venue and no online presentation options will be considered. Authors will need to bring a physical printed copy of their poster to display at the poster session at the conference (instruction will be provided after acceptance). At least one author per accepted poster will be required to register for the conference and attend the poster session in person.</p>
<p>As example, here are the Two Best Poster Awards of IEEE VR 2025 as exemplary model, especially for new authors to orient:</p>

<h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
<h2>IMPORTANT:</h2>
<p> <strong>Submissions need to be anonymized</strong>. Extended abstract and supplemental materials must not contain information that identifies the authors, their institutions, funding sources, or their places of work. Relevant previous work by the authors must be cited in the third person to preserve anonymity. <strong class="red">Failure to make reasonable attempts to adhere to this policy will result in desk rejection.</strong></p>
<p>Submissions to the poster track must be written in English and in the form of a two-page extended abstract (references included). It should include an abstract with a maximum of 100 words, a concise description of the idea, the results of findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a discussion of the contribution of the work in the selected area of work. Full literature review is not expected, although relevant key citations should be included. The submission <strong class="red">must be</strong> prepared in the IEEE Computer Society VGTC format (<a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/" target="_blank">https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/</a>) and submitted as PDF. We highly encourage authors to use the LaTeX template (<a href="https://github.com/ieeevgtc/vgtc_conference_latex/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/ieeevgtc/vgtc_conference_latex/releases</a>). Authors who use the Word template <strong class="red">must</strong> ensure that their PDF submission matches the format. Accepted two-page extended abstracts will be included in the Abstracts and Workshop Proceedings and, thus, will be archived in the IEEE Digital Library.</p>
<p>Poster extended abstracts must be submitted through the particular poster track available at the online submission site - <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions" target="_blank">https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions.</a> After logging into PCS, start your submission by selecting VR > IEEE VR 2026 > IEEE VR Posters 2026. Supplemental materials, such as a video or image, can be uploaded to the submission site but are not mandatory for the initial submission. However, authors must select one of the following topic categories    that best aligns with their poster's subject matter. This selection is important because posters will be organized by topic during the presentations , and these categories are designed to group similar topics under broader themes, ensuring a coherent and focused discussion.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interaction and Interfaces</strong> <br/>
    (e.g., 3D Interaction, Multimodal Input and Interaction, Gestures and Interactions)</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization and Rendering </strong><br>
    (e.g., Rendering and Displays, Visual Rendering, Immersive Visualization)</li>
  <li><strong>Haptic Feedback</strong><br>
    (e.g., Haptics, Touch, Tangible and Gesture Interfaces, Haptics and Vibrotactile)</li>
  <li><strong>Perception and Cognition</strong><br>
    (e.g., Perception and Cognition, Multimodal Perception and Experience, Depth and Distance Perception)</li>
  <li><strong>Collaboration, Virtual Humans and Social Applications</strong><br>
    (e.g., Collaboration, Social Applications, Social Interactions, Virtual Humans and Avatars, Virtual Humans and Agents)</li>
  <li><strong>User Experience and Presence</strong><br>
    (e.g., Evaluating Immersion, UX and Interaction, Experiences, Cybersickness and Presence, Plausibility, Presence and Social VR)</li>
  <li><strong>Training and Education</strong><br>
    (e.g., Training and Learning, Education Applications, Training and Virtual Humans, Healthcare, Medical Applications)</li>
  <li><strong>Locomotion, Navigation and Redirection</strong><br>
    (e.g., Locomotion and Redirection, Perception in Navigation, Locomotion and Redirection, Redirected Walking)</li>
  <li><strong>Ethical and Psychological Aspects</strong><br>
    (e.g., Ethics in VR, Psycho-and Sociocultural Dimensions of Virtual Identities, Cognition and Psychology)</li>
  <li><strong>Miscellaneous Topics</strong><br>
    (This category serves as a space for diverse and unique research topics that may not clearly align with the other identified thematic area)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In case of an acceptance, further material will be requested for the final Camera Ready deadline such as a teaser slide and a video.</em></p>
<h1>Poster Review Process</h1>
<p>Submissions will be reviewed using a juried process, during which each poster will be read and evaluated by two reviewers. If reviewers do not reach an agreement, the final decisions will be made collectively by the Posters Chairs. Authors will receive reviews of their submissions explaining the decision and providing feedback.<br/>
  The possible outcomes of this reviewing process are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Desk rejection due to violations of the IEEE VR submission policies</li>
  <li>Rejection</li>
  <li>Conditional Acceptance</li>
  <li>Acceptance</li>
</ul>
<p>Authors of accepted posters are expected to address any recommendations and conditions of acceptance prior to the final submission of camera-ready materials. This will be verified by the primary reviewer. </p>
<h1>Poster Presentation</h1>
<p>There will be three dedicated days for poster presentations throughout the conference week. Each accepted poster will be assigned to <strong class="red">one</strong> specific day and will have multiple presentation slots throughout that day, e.g., during coffee breaks, to maximize exposure and interaction with conference attendees. During the poster presentation, one or more authors need to be physically present at their poster to discuss their work with other attendees.</p>
<p>Due to the number of anticipated posters and other time constraints, there will not be a traditional poster fast-forward session at this year’s conference. Instead, <strong class="red">authors of accepted posters will be asked to provide a 30 to 60 second teaser video with their final submission, which will be showcased on the conference website, and a teaser image, which will be showcased at the conference venue.</strong> We will share more details including video requirements, teaser image requirements, and the anticipated date of presentation with the authors of accepted posters shortly after the notification of the results.</p>
<h1>Best Poster Awards</h1>
<p>The best poster award(s) will recognize the most outstanding poster contributions. It will be based on (1) the significance of the research contributions described in the submitted two-page extended abstracts, as well as (2) the clarity, creativity, design, and on-site presentation of the poster. Awards will not be selected by the Posters Chairs but by a committee of highly regarded individuals in our field. These awards will be noted in the program and presented with a signed certificate.</p>
<h1>The Large Language Model Policy</h1>
<p>Large-scale language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can only be used by the authors to edit grammar of their own text.</p>
<h1>Plagiarism</h1>
<p>All submissions must be original work not  previously presented at any workshop, symposium, or conference and not published in any archived conference proceeding, magazine, or journal. 
  At the time of submission, it is required by the authors to state explicitly in the submission form that the submitted work is the work by the authors themselves or is a summary of the authors’ previously presented/published work with clear attribution. Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and will lead to the removal of the submission from the review process. Please see the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/plagiarism/plagiarism.html" target="_blank">IEEE Plagiarism FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://pspb.ieee.org/images/files/files/opsmanual.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual for</a> more information.</p>
<h1>Contacts</h1>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The 33rd IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2026 seeks poster submissions that describe recently completed work, highly relevant results of work in progress, or successful systems and applications in all areas related to virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and 3D user interfaces. Presenting a poster is a great way to get feedback on work that has not yet been published.</p>
<p>Initial submissions should be in the form of a two-page extended abstract, which will undergo a review process. The poster design does not need to be submitted on the initial submission deadline. Authors whose extended abstracts are accepted will be able to submit their poster design as a PDF at the camera-ready deadline so that it will appear together with the extended abstract on IEEE eXplore. In addition, authors of accepted posters will be required to provide a teaser video and a teaser image. More information can be found in the Poster Presentation section of this call.</p>
<p>Poster presentations will be at the physical conference venue and no online presentation options will be considered. Authors will need to bring a physical printed copy of their poster to display at the poster session at the conference (instruction will be provided after acceptance). At least one author per accepted poster will be required to register for the conference and attend the poster session in person.</p>

<h2>Exemplary Posters</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>December 19, 2025:</strong> Title and authors information due</li>
  <li><strong>December 22, 2025:</strong> Two-page extended abstract and optional material submission due</li>

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Submissions need to be anonymized. Extended abstract and supplemental materials must not contain information that identifies the authors, their institutions, funding sources, or their places of work. Relevant previous work by the authors must be cited in the third person to preserve anonymity. Failure to comply will result in desk rejection.</p>
<p>Submissions must be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Written in English</li>
  <li>Two-page extended abstract (references included)</li>
  <li>Include: abstract (max 100 words), concise idea description, results, figures, and contributions</li>
  <li>IEEE VGTC format (PDF). Use the <a href="https://github.com/ieeevgtc/vgtc_conference_latex/releases" target="_blank">LaTeX template</a> (preferred) or ensure Word format matches</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit via <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions" target="_blank">PCS</a>: VR > IEEE VR 2026 > IEEE VR Posters 2026</p>

<h2>Review Process</h2>
<p>Juried review by two reviewers. Disagreements resolved by Posters Chairs. Outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Desk Rejection</li>
  <li>Rejection</li>
  <li>Conditional Acceptance</li>
  <li>Acceptance</li>
</ul>
<p>Accepted posters must address reviewer comments before final submission.</p>

<h2>Poster Presentation</h2>
<p>Posters will be presented physically at the conference over three days, with multiple presentation sessions each day (e.g., coffee breaks). One or more authors must be present at the poster.</p>
<p>Instead of a fast-forward session, authors must submit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A 30–60 second teaser video (for website)</li>
  <li>A teaser image (for venue display)</li>
</ul>
<p>More details will follow upon acceptance.</p>

<h2>Best Poster Awards</h2>
<p>Based on research contribution, design, and presentation. Judged by an independent expert committee. Winners noted in the program and awarded a certificate.</p>

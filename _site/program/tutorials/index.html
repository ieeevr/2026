            <h3>Summary</h3>
            
            
                <p>
                    In this tutorial, we will present and discuss the challenges of exploiting novel XR technologies in the field of healthcare, specifically to develop serious games and exercises for a wide range of cognitive and physical issues, ranging from training to assessment. In such a domain, VR experts should collaborate and work in synergy with doctors, physiotherapists, and healthcare specialists. Though the interest in XR applications in healthcare has recently gained popularity, a big gap between the technological advances in VR and 3D technologies and their effective use in clinical practice still exists. Indeed, XR setups adopted by hospitals and rehabilitation centers seldom exploit the more recent VR/AR/MR solutions. On the other hand, VR/AR/MR researchers still pay little attention to the cognitive, perceptual, and physical specificity of patients and users affected by specific disabilities and impairments. 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    In this tutorial, Manuela Chessa and Fabio Solari will exploit their expertise in the development of VR and AR solutions, with specific attention to cognitive and perceptual aspects, and their expertise coming from a longtime collaboration in international projects addressing healthcare issues. 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The aim of the tutorial is to revise the theoretical backgrounds of VR development, to present and discuss the opportunities and the limits of current technologies and software solutions, and to focus on the existing gaps between VR communities and healthcare ones.

                <p>
                    Presence has been a cornerstone of Virtual Reality (VR) research since the early 1990s, focusing on the phenomena where users experience illusions of being in virtual environments (Place Illusion, PI), believing in the reality of those events (Plausibility Illusion, Psi), feeling ownership over a virtual body, and sensing the presence of others (copresence). This tutorial addresses these aspects and introduces novel evaluation methods. Recent advancements have reshaped our understanding of presence, suggesting PI is based on natural sensorimotor contingencies within VR, Psi depends on the environment's response to user actions and coherence with real-life expectations, and body ownership stems from multisensory integration. The tutorial will explore how presence can now be quantified using probability theory and Reinforcement Learning, bypassing traditional questionnaires and measures. It also highlights an inverse relationship between PI and the entropy of eye scanpaths, providing a solid empirical basis for the study of PI. This tutorial is designed for researchers and practitioners seeking to deepen their understanding of VR's scientific principles, particularly presence. It is beneficial for both research and the design and testing of VR applications, requiring some prior VR experience and ideally, a grasp of experimental design and analysis. Participants will learn the conceptual framework of presence and its evaluation through lectures and practical experiences, including multi-participant environments from the GuestXR European Project. This hands-on approach will demonstrate how various factors, like sensorimotor contingencies, affect presence in settings such as multi-person meetings. Attendees will gain a comprehensive theoretical understanding of presence and insights into assessing contributing and detracting factors, including experimental design and evaluation.

                    <p>
                        This tutorial is aimed at researchers and practitioners who wish to gain a deeper understanding of the scientific basis of virtual reality with respect to the issue of presence. This will be useful for research, but also for the design and testing of applications. Participants should ideally have had some prior experience of VR. Some understanding of experimental design and analysis would be useful, but not essential. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The audience will learn about the conceptual framework of presence and about how to evaluate it for experimental studies or practical implementations. Moreover, they would learn this not only through lectures but through some actual experiences making use of multi-participant environments developed in the GuestXR European Project. These experiences will show, in a practical way, how varying contributing factors (such as the sensorimotor contingencies) influence the illusions of presence, for example, in multi-person meetings. The audience is expected therefore to take away a deeper theoretical appreciation of the long-standing issues of presence and be able judge how to assess the factors that lead to and detract from it, including the issue of experimental design and evaluation.

                        Immersive analytics (IA) is a research discipline that seeks to leverage emerging display technology such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) for the purpose of information and data visualization. Applications of IA techniques offer several opportunities over traditional data visualization techniques such as spatial immersion, multi-sensory presentation, situated visualization, engagement, and collaboration. However, with additional opportunities come additional challenges. IA systems and visualizations comprise a vast and nascent design space that span different display technologies, input modalities, hardware systems, interactions, and visualization design practices. These dimensions make it challenging for researchers and developers to design and implement IA visualizations and systems.

                        Beyond developing effective IA systems, the challenge of creating collaborative immersive applications is daunting. Implementing data synchronization of interactive elements of the environment, sharing synchronized avatars and presence, and voice and/or video sharing represents a non-trivial engineering feat for most developers. This is especially challenging in education and research environments where resources are limited.

                        The main goal of this course is to equip researchers to face these challenges by familiarizing them with the development of immersive and collaborative visualizations with web technology, and giving them a practical starting point for creating their own applications and environments.

                <p>
                    This tutorial is tailored for individuals who have entered the virtual reality (VR) domain during the recent resurgence of head-mounted displays (HMDs), offering an introduction to fixed-screen immersive displays, also known as CAVE-style VR. The session will commence with a historical overview of CAVE-style VR, contrasting it with head-based displays to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each, and guide participants in determining the optimal use cases for both modalities.

                    The tutorial will delve into the distinctions in rendering and interaction techniques between fixed-screen and head-based systems, providing a high-level overview of the matrix operations involved in generating off-axis stereoscopic images for fixed screens and discussing the implications for CAVE rendering versus HMDs. Additionally, the evolution of hardware for implementing fixed-screen VR displays will be discussed, including advancements that have minimized the spatial requirements of CAVE systems, such as short-throw projectors and direct-view LED systems, and innovations in stereoscopic glasses that enable multiple users to experience a shared CAVE environment from individual perspectives.

                    Participants will also be introduced to the diverse configurations of fixed-screen systems, ranging from classic 4-sided CAVEs to more complex setups like 6-sided cubic CAVEs, extra-large CAVEs, movable screens, the StarCAVE, the Pipe, CAVE2, and others. The tutorial will further explore a variety of software solutions compatible with modern fixed-screen VR systems, including integration with the Unity Game Engine, open-source scientific visualization tools like ParaView and COVISE, commercial tools such as Amira, and VR libraries like Vrui, FreeVR, vrJuggler, and HEV. The session will conclude with a discussion on the role of the OpenXR standard in the context of fixed-screen VR displays.

    <h2>About the IEEE VR Conference</h2>
    <p>
        The IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR) is the premier international event for the presentation of research results in the broad areas of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR). Since 1993, IEEE VR has presented groundbreaking research and accomplishments by virtual reality pioneers: scientists, engineers, designers, and artists, paving the way for the future. Soon, IEEE VR expanded its scope to also include augmented, mixed, and other forms of mediated reality. Similarly, the IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI), which started as a workshop at IEEE VR in 2004, has become the premier venue for 3D user interfaces and 3D interaction in virtual environments. In 2018, VR and 3DUI were merged into the IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, with the short name IEEE VR. In 2020, VR was the first major IEEE conference to be held entirely online and in a virtual environment.

	<h2>About Saint-Malo, Brittany, France</h2>
    <p>
        Saint-Malo is a port city located in the Brittany region of northwestern France, about 2 to 3 hours from Paris. It enchants visitors with its rich history, captivating architecture, and picturesque landscapes. Enclosed within formidable granite walls, it was once a pirate stronghold (corsairs approved by the King of France) strongly fortified against Norman and English attacks. This fortified port city exudes an old-world charm, offering a glimpse into its maritime past. Wander through the narrow cobblestone streets of the intra-muros (walled city) and discover charming cafes, boutiques, and historic landmarks such as the imposing Saint-Malo Cathedral. Beyond the city walls, visitors can explore stunning beaches, including the renowned Plage du Sillon, or embark on a journey to the nearby Mont Saint-Michel, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Whether strolling along the ramparts, indulging in fresh seafood, or simply soaking in the maritime ambiance, Saint-Malo offers a captivating blend of history, culture, and natural beauty that leaves a lasting impression on all who visit.
